# Bluesky hack

Welcome to the Bluesky network prototype ðŸŒž

To learn more about the Bluesky network check out our docs on [Network architecture]() and the [Blogpost on self-authenticating data structures]().

We encourage you to play around with the tools here, but please do not use anything here in production. This is a _proof of concept_ meant to demonstrate the core functionality of the bluesky network.

## What's here?

This is a monorepo containing three packages:

- `common`: This is the bluesky SDK that contains implementations of:
  - the repository data structure structure 
  - a sample network namespace (microblogging) with both a full client and delegator client implementation
  - an authorization library for working with bluesky-capable UCANs
  - some helpers for making calls to a bluesky data server

  This package is published on npm as [bsky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bsky)

- `server`: This is an implementation of a bluesky server. For simplicity's sake, it actually combines the function of three "roles" in the network:
  - **Identity:** 
    - maintains a mapping of username -> DID
  - **Data:** 
    - maintains a pointer to the latest root CID of a data repository. 
    - verifies the authority of pushes to your repo and updates the root.
    - servers the repository for pulls.
    - acts as a delgatee and makes udpates to your repository for properly authorized requests
    - sends updates to other data/indexing servers that have subscribed to a particular DID that it is hosting
  - **Indexing:**
    - stores an indexed version of repositories that it is hosting or that its user's are following
    - returned global view of data including follower lists, aggregated like counts, and user timelines.

- `cli`: This is a basic command line interface for interactions with the bluesky network :
  - creating a local repository
  - registering a user
  - creating/editing/deleting posts
  - creating/deleting likes
  - viewing a user's timeline
  - viewing a user's feed

  _Note: the cli uses a delegator client at the moment. We are adding the option to use a full client soon._

## Quick use
_Requires Node>=15, and yarn_

Want to jump right in? Follow these steps to get a sample two server network up and running.

This demo takes four terminal windows: 
- two servers to show of data federation
- two cli clients representing two users on separate servers interaction

The number in parantheses tells you which terminal to run each command in

From project root:
```bash
# install dependencies
(1) yarn

# build projects
(1) yarn build

# run server
(1) yarn server # runs on localhost:2583

# in a separate terminal, run a second server
(2) yarn server:alt # runs on localhost:2584

# set an env var to store alice's repo in a scoped dir
(3) export SKY_REPO_PATH="~/.sky-alice"

# set an env var to store bob's repo in a scoped dir
(4) export SKY_REPO_PATH="~/.sky-bob"

# register alice
(3) yarn cli init
# prompt with 'alice' for username, 'localhost:2583' for host & true for registration

# register bob
(4) yarn cli init
# prompt with 'bob' for username, 'localhost:2584' for host & true for registration

# make a couple posts as alice
(3) yarn cli post "hello world"
(3) yarn cli post "howdy"

# follow alice as bob
(4) yarn cli follow alice@localhost:2583

# like alice's post
(4) yarn cli like alice@localhost:2583 {post_id from alice post} # the post id has the format `3iwc-gvs-ehpk-2s`

# view your timeline
(4) yarn cli timeline

# list your follows
(3/4) yarn cli list follows

# list your followers
(3/4) yarn cli list followers

# list your feed
(3/4) yarn cli feed

# list your followers
(3/4) yarn cli list followers

# list your feed
(3/4) yarn cli feed

# view alice's feed as bob
(4) yarn cli feed alice@localhost:2583

# Keep playing around. Try unliking, deleting or editing posts, or add a third user into the mix! They can be registered to one of the existing servers
```

## Documentation
We are putting together more detailed documentation for the server API as well as the SDK.

If you are inclined to play with either, your best option is to check the tests to see how to use each part of the library.

Specifically:

`server/test/delegator.ts` contains an example of multiple users interaction on a 2 server network

`server/test/indexer.ts` contains an example of multiple users interaction on a 2 server network


## Notes for code spelunkers
We hope you jump into the code to explore these concepts alongside us. Feel free to create issues/discussion with problems that you come across or questions that you have.
